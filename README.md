This is a personal portfolio website that showcases my work, projects, and blog posts. It is built with React, Typescript, and NextJS and the blog posts are written in markdown. I don't write blog posts often, but make sure to check them out when I do!

Check out the live site [here](https://www.pab.dev/).
