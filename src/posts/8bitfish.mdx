Check out 8Bitfish on [github](https://github.com/8bitfish).

Before 8Bitfish I knew very little about programming or working in a team. I was currently learning React (knowing very little javascript) and building small projects to try to understand the basics of building websites. During this time I was more interested in web design and animation, only having learned the basics of web development to participate in a project called [ClubCompass](https://github.com/paul-bokelman/cc). As the weeks went by, I gained more and more experience and knowledge about React and the realm of web development and even secretly liked it...

Everything was going great, then the shit hit the fan. COVID decided to present itself to the world and me and my teams main source of programming: ClubCompass, had to come to an end.

Since COVID not only cancelled ClubCompass, our education, and our social life, me and my teammates were left pheening for a project like drug addicts bumping their last line of coke. Amazingly, within just a couple weeks, my teammate, and now good friend, [Abhinav Palacharla](https://github.com/AbhinavPalacharla) had found an upcoming hackathon called [AngelHacks 2.0](https://angelhacks-2.devpost.com/). The rules of the competition were simple: you get 48 hours and you can program anything.

We jumped straight into planning with just 3 days before the 48 hour countdown. Currently our team was just me, Abhinav, and [Andrew Hale](https://github.com/AndrewH06), but we needed one more. With a bit of effort we found our 4th and final teammate [Clara Jeon](https://github.com/clarajeon126) on discord and got down to brainstorming.
