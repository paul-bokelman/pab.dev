I feel like writing so here's a short story of my journey into the world of machine learning and genetic algorithms.

I've always been fascinated by the theory of evolution and how organisms evolve, adapt, and survive in their environments. This idea that such complex systems can emerge out of simple set of rules has always simultanously baffled and amazed me. Recently, this interest in evolution has also given me immense motivation in gathering an understanding of how machines "learn". With the rise of AI and the pletora of content avaliable on the topic, I decided to get my hands dirty and finally understand this magical technology.
